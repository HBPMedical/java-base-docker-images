# The master for this script exists in the Python '2.7' directory. Do
# not edit the version of this script found in other directories. When

# Ensure that any failure within this script causes this script to fail
# immediately. This eliminates the need to check individual statuses for
# anything which is run and prematurely exit. Note that the feature of
# bash to exit in this way isn't foolproof. Ensure that you heed any
# advice in:
#
#   http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105
#   http://fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_Error_handling
#
# and use best practices to ensure that failures are always detected.
# Any user supplied scripts should also use this failure mode.
